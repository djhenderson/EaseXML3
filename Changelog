    parameter for Node constructor.

    nodes handled by a given XMLObject instance.

    nodes in direct children instead of all the XML document (Thanks to
    Jacob Fan for the patch).

  * `noLimit` ChoiceNode keyword added. Use it if you want multiple instances
    of a Node in the same ChoiceNode.
  * Re-worked XML beautiful-output in a new module (PrettyXMLPrinter).
  * One-node-XMLObjects support using special attribute name 'mainNode'
