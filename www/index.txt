About
=====

EaseXML3 tends to be an object-xml mapper. It allows to translate XML to
Python objects and vice-versa. Your developer life is made easier :

1. design some classes with special attributes
2. manipulate the objects in the Python way
3. translate to XML

Basically EaseXML3 provides a new object type : XMLObject. Of course,
it's possible to build XMLObjects given some XML data. For further
information, read the small documentation_ which takes an example to
explain EaseXML3's features. EaseXML3 is released under the Python
Software Foundation License.

The project is registered at the `Python Package Index`_ and in Freshmeat_

  New website is up ! Update your bookmarks

- **24 Nov 2004**:
  **The project name is changing from XMLObject to EaseXML3**. But
  XMLObject class name will remain. So you will only need to modify
  the package import statement in your code. Old news will keep trace
  of old name. The SVN repository will be renamed, i'm wondering
  wether i should do the same for the mailing list .. or not. Keep in
  touch :)

- **11 Nov 2004**:
  `Joshua Buysse`_ built a binary package of XMLObject for the CSW
  project CSW is a set of prebuilt packages for Solaris systems. He

EaseXML3 source code is now hosted on a Subversion repository on
http://svn.base-art.net. To access it you have 3 alternatives:

- browser-friendly nice output and diff capabilities with ViewCVS
- DAV read-only access:

  * `svn co http://svn.base-art.net/public/easexml`

- DAV restricted read/write access:

  * `svn co https://svn.base-art.net/full/easexml`
  * ... `svn commit`

- Aggregator-friendly RSS feed at:

  * http://svn.base-art.net/easexml.xml

If you want commit rights to the repository, let me know.
The repository is organized this way (the 'classic' one):

- `trunk` : Bleeding edge
- `tags` : Mainly release marks, making a moment in the repository
  history available
- `branches` : Placeholder where to put long-time parallel EaseXML3
  branches

Well I'm not absolutely sure of the meaning of life of the schema. So
correct me if i'm wrong :) The SVNBook_ says it's good, i believe it.
