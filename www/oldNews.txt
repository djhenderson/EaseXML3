  Added a commit monitoring mailing list. It is intended to developers who
  want to keep in touch with developpement. Though the traffic on this list is
  not very high these days :) See Contact_ for further informations.
- **04 Sep 2004**:
  Thanks to Jkx_ for setting up a mailing list manager :) A mailing list for
  XMLObject is now available. See Contact_ for more informations.
- **23 Aug 2004**:
  Another maintenance release, fixing one very annoying recursive
  related bug reported by Ray, TD Travis and Fuzzy at Voidspace. I'm now
  providing Zip distribution archive in addition of tarGz. The HTML
  documentation is included in the distribution too ..

- **05 Aug 2004**:
  A maintenance release, fixing few bugs and adding a CommentNode
  type. As usual see the Changelog_ :-)

- **31 Jul 2004**: 
  After few months of apparent sleep, the nice
  Tagged-Python wakes up to release XMLObject 0.1.0. Many features
  added since last release. XMLObject should now be more reliable and
  usable. See the Changelog_ for more details. The documentation_ has
  also been updated. The unit-tests even pass successfully :-)

- **04 Jul 2004**:
  Thanks to Christian_ for the brand new XMLObject logo. Dude you did good
  job man ! Other versions of the logo:
  
  * Big_ one
  * Small_ one 

- **16 Jun 2004**:
  Mainly a maintenance release, fixing a bug in TextNode, noticed by Joshua
  H. Rothenberg. See Changelog for more details.

- **13 Jun 2004**:
  I've hacked a CSS tip_ to build a small menu. I did it quick and
  dirty, but it seems to work. Beside these web-design news, I've
  planned another XMLObject release with XML-Schema support. Stay
  tuned !

- **03 Jun 2004**:
  0.0.2 is out. See Changelog_ for more details. Finally got registering to
  Pypi :-)

- **27 May 2004**: 
  After a little discussion on Ian's blog_, I recognize it is a mistake to
  place XMLObject under GPL. The next release will be under a more
  appropriate licence.

- **23 May 2004**:
  This is the first XMLObject release. Read the documentation_ to have an
  overview of what XMLObject can do right now.
